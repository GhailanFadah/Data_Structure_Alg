contains the projects for data structure and algorithms course at Colby college. Big data files have been omitted and should be obtained locally.

# Project 1: Black-Jack & ArrayLists
recreated the famous game Blackjack using simplified rules with a player and a dealer with an emphasizes on my own built ArraysLists as the data structure. Afterwards simulations were ran to gather stats about the game.

# Project 2: Conway’s Life Game & 2D Arrays
recreated Conway's way of life game with an emphasizes on 2D arrays (landscape) where each cell is either alive or dead through each generation based on rules of game.

# Project 3: Sudoku & Stacks
created a program that finds the solution to a board of Sudoku if there is one. It can also create its own random board and try to solve it if no board is passed. This was
accomplished using a backtracking algorithm with a focus on using an implemented Stack data structure.

afterwards the program was explored to test its limitations and efficiency.

# Project 4: Agents & LinkedLists
created an agent based simulation. Each agent either moves or not based on certain conditions. If they move they are displayed in a light color, if not they are
displayed in a dark color. Each agent has a specific radius and the goal is for each agent to have at least three neighbors within its radius. A main component of this project was the implemented LinkList which was used extensively in order to keep track of the agents in the landscape and access their attributes.

# Project 5: Customer & Queue
created a simulation for 3 types of customers to analyze which method is best when choosing a checkout line. The 3 customer types were choosing a random line, looking for the smallest line, and picking the shorter line from two random lines. In order to simulate a line an implemented queue was used to keep track of customers and their items in each line.

After some data collections and analysis, the data suggests that the customer with the smallest wait time is a customer that randomly chooses their checkout line.

# Project 6: Reddit & BST
Implemented a binary search tree and used it to analyze reddit comments from 2015-2018. The key-value pair architecture was used where each unique word was a key and its value is the amount of times it appeared in the dataset. The results suggest that more unique words were used as time passed.

# Project 7: Reddit & Hashmap
Implemented a Hashmap and compared its performance to a BST on the same reddit dataset. Performed much quicker but used much more space. Again key-value pair architecture was used.

# Project 8: Reddit & PQ
Explored and implemented how a priority queue can give us best of both worlds between BST and Hasmap. Used it to see trends of certain words over time. One topic I explored was soccer and as expected "messi" was on top.

# Project 9: Graphs & Dijkstra's Algorithm
Implemented a graph using an adjacency list and used it to explore Dijkstra's algorithm. Also explored and implemented DFS & BFS search.

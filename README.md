contains the projects for data structure and algorithms course at Colby college. Big data files have been omitted and should be obtained locally.

# Project 1: Black-Jack & ArrayLists
recreated the famous game Blackjack using simplified rules with a player and a dealer with an emphasizes on my own built ArraysLists as the data structure. Afterwards simulations were ran to gather stats about the game.

# Project 2: Conway’s Life Game & 2D Arrays
recreated Conway's way of life game with an emphasizes on 2D arrays (landscape) where each cell is either alive or dead through each generation based on rules of game.

# Project 2: Sudoku & Stacks
created a program that finds the solution to a board of Sudoku if there is one. It can also create its own random board and try to solve it if no board is passed. This was
accomplished using a backtracking algorithm with a focus on using an implemented Stack data structure.

afterwards the program was explored to test its limitations and efficiency.
